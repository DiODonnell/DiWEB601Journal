# Week Two in WEB601
![Web](wire.jpg)


Week 2 went in a flash as we learnt to use Git as a team and worked on a basic website as a team.
It began with a bit of confusion as we all learnt the mechanics and processes of using git 
collaboratively as well as finding a channel to communicate effectively in such a way that
we could work together on the same project but in a remote fashion. Coordinating a team can 
be challenging - yet by using Slack to communicate we found our way into a process that worked
well. I learnt a lot - how to delete remote branches that popped up - if you push a branch of 
another name a branch is created automatically in the remote repo and there was initially a bit
of confusion on what a merge really is and that it would overwrite an earlier push not merge all
the code together from two versions of a file. We got there in the end and it was an invaluable
experience that has prepared me for using Git for the actual project and for the software devlopment 
project. Because it was such a big learning curve it took many hours but absolutely worth it as
I proceed with my projects.

I have also spent many hours going through tutorials which has also been invaluable for moving
ahead. Preperation like this sets a grounding I can extend from as I learn during the project
development. Code Academy is great and as like all languages there is continual evolvement and
I learnt some new HTML additions and in particular new CSS for example using Grids to create
layouts that are easier to manipulate than previously. I've started learning Javascript through
Code Academy and find the tutorials a great way of learning for you code as you go.

Out tutor has encouraged us in our learning and is a great motivator who brings real life ancedotes
from the workplace that really help put what we are learning in context. Classes are great with
learning mixed with explanations, the value of what we are learning with examples from surveys
and it is exciting to think that the languages and skills we are getting from this course are
sought after in the workplace. There is a 'real' feeling about what we are doing that gives me 
motivation and encouragement for the future.

I was nervous about approaching a business for my project and spent some time looking around and noticed
a new business that did not have a website. I dropped in and they were really receptive and as one of
the partners was an ex NMIT student also keen to support me in my project and understood that I
would need to met requirements! We had a good discussion that gave me a good overview of the business
and how they would like that business projected on a website. I have emailed them today going over what 
we discussed to ensure I had got in my head what was in theirs. I have asked to meet again in the next
few days to sketch up some wireframes and get agreement on what they want to achieve with the website - 
so basically user requirement gathering. I will follow the process we have been given for devlopment in
the class Gitbook and document as I go. I'm really excited about working with real clients and once over
the first approach to them feel less nervous and really wanting to create something for them that will
give value to their business and users as well as learning the entire process to add to my knowledge base
- a win-win situation.


I realise I am remiss with getting week 2 written in my journal and will structure my weeks in such a way
that I have allocated times and days in a scedule so that my workflow is organised and will allow me to meet 
deadlines etc. It is a bit like harnessing a wild storm at the moment but I have got tutorials for three of
my courses nearly completed and will feel more confident moving onfrom here.
