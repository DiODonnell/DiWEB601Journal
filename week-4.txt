This week we have practiced writing functions in JavaScript. I’m not sure if I am returning a Boolean
in some of them that are meant to return a true if a truthy. It is interesting how the functions work
and trying to keep my code as clean as possible as well as using good naming conventions takes thought
as well.

I’m most of the way through the Code Academy JavaScript tutorials but hit a roadblock with the tutorials
using Babel as the terminal kept crashing. It was a lot of information to retain and am sure using it in
a practical sense will be where most of my learning becomes solidified. Having the base to work from,
which the tutorials have provided, has been really helpful, yet can be confusing at times or maybe it
is also so much information to process I need more time to digest it.

I have arranged to meet with the business owners to draw up the wireframes for the project and
to further discuss what functionality will be required in the website. I will use A4 paper to
represent a full screen version of the website for the starting point. Then I will create versions
for mobile platforms in the appropriate sizes. There was a good tip on folding paper to get the
sizes for mobile and tablets.

I will be meeting with my tutors on Friday to discuss the suitability of my proposal for the website
project as will need to meet the brief guidelines. I can add functionality to the site that is
suited to the requirements of the business – yet provides the interactive components required
by the brief. As I am new to JavaScript getting my tutors input into what will be achievable
in terms of functionality for the timeframe and my lack of experience using it will be very
important.
